This compilation linktree website was made during my **third month** learning frontend web development.

The individual HTML-CSS projects linked here were created during my **first month** of study, based on [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) tutorials. This website serves as an organized and styled hub to navigate all of them easily, while also showcasing my growth in layout structuring, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## üîç Overview

This project is a single-page website that acts as a visual hub for my HTML and CSS practice sheets. It includes accessible navigation, visual icons for each project, dark mode support, and fully responsive behavior across screen sizes.

It was designed mobile-first and styled using CSS custom properties, ARIA enhancements, and semantic HTML to provide a learning portfolio that looks polished and professional while still rooted in beginner-level concepts.

- Mobile-first responsive layout using `clamp()` and `media queries`
- Custom dark mode theme using `prefers-color-scheme`
- Accessible skip link and descriptive ARIA labels
